# Lawn Pawn Design Decisions

Lawn Pawn was designed to imitate a yard, being an application for yard sales.
Posts alternate colors to resemble the pattern of a freshly-mown lawn.
Logging in and signing up were placed in an easily accessible part of the navigation menu to make it easy for users to get started with making posts and interacting with the application as soon as possible.
The login and sign up buttons are replaced with account deletion and logout buttons as to not create confusion for a logged-in user.
The user should not be able to log in to two accounts at one time.
The post creation section is replaced by an message telling the user to log in first to make it clear when a user can and cannot create a post.
The user can always return to the main page by selecting 'Lawn Pawn' in the left of the navigation bar at the top of the screen.

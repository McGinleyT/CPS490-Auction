# 1. Introduction
   * Purpose
      * This document defines the initial ideas for a basic auction web application. The system's purpose is to let authenticated users to list items for auction, browse all active auctions, open an auction to see its details with a real-time countdown, and bid using tokens with a live bid history.
   * Scope
      * User-level functionality captured as use cases and use case descriptions for each required feature.
      * One communication diagram per use case.
      * activity diagrams capturing behavior across or within use cases.
   * Definitions & Acronyms
      * Active Action - An auction that has started and has not yet reached its end time.
      * Token - The in-app bidding currency used to place bids.
      * Bid History – Chronological record of accepted bids for a given auction, shown to users in near real time.
      * Real-time – Server-to-client updates during an auction.
      * UI – User Interface (the web page/screens users interact with).
      * Use Case – A description of system behavior from a user’s perspective to achieve a goal.
      * Communication Diagram – UML interaction diagrams showing objects and message order.
      * Activity Diagram – UML diagram that models control flow and decision logic.
   * References
      * Any documents referred to in the creation of this systems analysis.
   * Overview
      * Section 2 - Overall description: goes into more details about this idea as a product.
      * 
# 2. Overall Description
   * Product Perspective
      * The system is using the MERN stack architecture for creating and running the application:
         - MongoDB is used to handle database functions.
         - Express.js is used to build the web application and associated APIs.
         - React is used to develop the user interface.
         - Node.js is the runtime environment that the application will run in.
   * Product Functions
      * Users can create an account allowing them to:
         - Place items up for auction.
         - Make bids on existing auctions.
      * Users can view all active auctions and choose filters to find relevant auctions.
      * Users can click on an auction to see details and place a bid.
   * User Characteristics
      * Users may be individuals seeking to place bids on ongoing auctions.
      * Users may be seeking to place items up for auction.
      * Users may not be looking for a particular auction, but may find one that they are interested in after acessing the application.
